This application is generated using [LoopBack 4 CLI](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Command-line-interface.html) with the
[initial project layout](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-application-layout.html).

## Database Setup

This application uses PostgreSQL as its database. You can run it with either a local PostgreSQL instance or a cloud database like Render.

### Local Development

1. Install PostgreSQL locally
2. Create a database named `friendsdb`
3. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and update the database credentials if needed
4. The default configuration connects to `localhost:5432` with user `postgres`

### Cloud Database (Render)

1. Create a PostgreSQL database on [Render](https://render.com)
2. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` from your Render database dashboard
3. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your deployment
4. The application will automatically use the cloud database when `DATABASE_URL` is set
